      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Fourth-Year Mechanical Engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. My career interests include additive manufacturing, defense, and general mechanical design work. I am the Treasurer of the WPI Combat Robotics club, one of the most prestigious collegiate combat robotics organizations in the country, and develop combat robots at the 3lb, 12lb, and 30lb weight classes (think, Battlebots but at a smaller scale).
